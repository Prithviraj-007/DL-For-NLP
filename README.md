# Sanskriti Samvaad: Unveiling Museum Stories with AI

## Project Description

Sanskriti Samvaad is an AI-powered project designed to enrich museum experiences by enabling users to explore and comprehend museum artifacts through image-based queries. Leveraging the fine-tuned LLaVA model (llava-1.5-7b-hf-ft-museum), the system generates informative responses based on user queries and corresponding artifact images.

## Key Features

- **Image-based Querying:** Users can upload images of museum artifacts and pose related questions.
- **LLaVA-powered Responses:** The system employs the fine-tuned LLaVA model to interpret images and provide informative responses.

## Model Description (llava-1.5-7b-hf-ft-museum)

The llava-1.5-7b-hf-ft-museum model is a refined iteration of the LLaVA model (llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf), specifically tailored to museum artifact data.

### More Information Needed:

**Museum Artifact Data Used:**
- Source, size, and types of artifacts in the dataset.
  
**Fine-tuning Process:**
- Description of the fine-tuning process, including techniques such as data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Intended Uses & Limitations

### Intended Uses:
- Enhance museum visitor experiences through interactive exploration via image-based queries.
- Aid researchers and curators in retrieving information from museum artifacts.
- Democratize access to museum knowledge by catering to a broader audience.

### Limitations:
- Model accuracy is contingent upon the quality and relevance of the training data.
- Complexity or novelty of queries may challenge the system.
- Manage user expectations regarding response comprehensiveness and factual accuracy.
