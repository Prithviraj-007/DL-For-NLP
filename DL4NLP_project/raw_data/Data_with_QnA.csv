Wt. 32.7 oz. (927.1 g)",Thanjavur,Metal,"This lota, or water container, is probably based on earlier models of seventeenth-century India that also survived after the beginning of British rule in the region. Its checkerboard pattern, perhaps derived from early Hindu decoration, reflects Islamic influence as well—specifically, the prominance of geometric patterns in the Islamic world. The square unit exists not only in the checkerboard design but also as a repeated sequence of diamond shapes in the band above the vessel's belly. The technique of employing brass and copper together on the same object, unique to India, is called ganga-jumna, after the contrasting colors of the Ganges and Jumna rivers. The Museum's lota most likely was made in Thanjavur, known for its superior brass production in the nineteenth century.","[[[ 70  71  75]

This painting, which is inspired by an earlier portrait in the collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum, represents the localization of an imperial Mughal style into regional schools in the late-seventeenth century Here, the three-dimensionality favored during the Jahangir and Shah Jahan periods gives way to flat blocks of color that rejects any sense of naturalistic space.","[[[199 215 227]

The style of portraiture created during his reign changed dramatically with the influx of European prints into India. He had many of these prints copied, so closely that the visitors who had brought them could not distinguish the originals, and this zest for accuracy is reflected in the painting here. A straightforward likeness, this portrait is very different in tone from the allegorical portraits of emperors that were also popular. No putti herald the emperor from the heavens and there is no representation of his vast domains in the background. Rather, Jahangir is presented as a lover of books, a no-nonsense ruler squarely in the line of those listed in the chart on the back of the painting, which gives his genealogy stretching back to Timur.","[[[146 174 174]

This bracelet is adorned with what appear to be yali or makara heads-—fierce mythical creatures that are seen in architecture and decorative arts in the subcontinent.This example is one of what originally would have been a pair. The silver surface has been embellished with enamel (minakari). This multi-step technique involves engraving decorative impressions on the surface of a metal object, which is then painted with viscous colored glass and fired into place. The process creates vibrant polychrome jewels and objects in a variety of patterns and colors.This ornament was formerly in the collection of American artist and designer Lockwood de Forest (1850–1932) who purchased many jeweled objects while traveling in India between 1879–1881.

(34.9 cm)",,Textiles-Woven,"Carpets composed of flowers and vines arranged on neutral backgrounds were produced in great numbers during the reign of Shah Jahan in the seventeenth century. This velvet fragment was originally part of such a composition. The large flower in the center relates to the technique of pietra dura in which precious stones, often depicting floral motifs, are inlaid into marble in architectural settings. The discrete shapes of solid, unshaded color that form the flower are reminiscent of one of the techniques seen in the inlaid stones of pietra dura, which was at its peak around the time this textile was produced.","[[[ 64  64  64]

Before he could be killed, however, the div, by his magic arts, turned himself into a stone. Only Rustam was strong enough to lift the rock and carry it to the Iranian shah. He then threatened to break the rock to bits unless the div resumed his own shape. When he complies, Kai Kavus saw that he was not worthy of kingship and ordered him executed. The artist has unequivocally rendered the might of the hero Rustam, shown larger than other figures and further dramatized by his pictured progress along the top of a foreground's ridge.

The story was a popular subject for public recitation in coffeehouses, so exciting and full of fantastic elements were the tales. The young emperor Akbar commissioned an illustrated version of the manuscript consisting of 1,400 large illustrations, each over two feet tall, with text on the reverse to aid in recitation. It was the earliest and most ambitious product of the royal painting atelier, and its paintings betray an early fusion of Persian and local Indian styles.In this painting, Zambur, a spy, brings a maid named Mahiya to town on a donkey. The figures and animals, the trees along the arcaded street, and details such as the fruit borne in panniers by one donkey are carefully observed and rendered in a more naturalistic way than would be found in contemporary Iranian miniatures. Yet the extreme diagonal of the composition has resulted in an awkward jumble of buildings, particularly on the left, where rooftops tip precipitously and a staircase leads nowhere.","[[[109 116 113]

After being exported to Europe in the colonial period, a modified version of the patka became part of tuxedo sets, taking its name from the Hindustani and Persian term kamarband, which means ‘waist bound up’. Individual stitches running the length of this patka create pleating in the fabric, indicating that it was worn folded over with the ends splayed out.","[[[186 183 179]

In a painting of Shah Jahan, he is seen to be wearing a similar garment tied with lappets on the right. He is also dressed in tight-fitting trousers, a colorful sash holding a dagger, and a bejeweled turban. Grandees of the realm wore similar clothing but dressed according to their rank.

If his father, Akbar, commissioned works of art as elements of a dynamic imperial vision, the son did so for delectation and spiritual nourishment. His miniatures, architecture, objects, and autobiography, theTuzuk-i Jahangiri, reveal him as a responsible–if quirky, warm-blooded, and sometimes cruel–ruler, whose aesthetic concerns left enough time and energy for essential statecraft. Few rulers in world history match his artistic discernment or breadth of taste. He collected pictures and objects from the Islamic world and beyond: Chinese porcelains, Augsburg gilt-bronze statuettes, engravings by Dürer and the Flemish Mannerists, and Renaissance jewels as well as Persian miniatures. On coming to the throne, he released a large proportion of the imperial artists and craftsmen to feudatory courts and to the bazaar workshops, keeping only those whose work met his standards of seriousness and restraint.","[[[ 77  79  79]

The fragment’s intricate design reveals the object’s method of production which is akin to the technique of painting.The vibrant red color of the textile, seen on the borders, comes from the organic dye material of the chay root plant indicating that it was likely made near the region of the Coromandel Coast located in Southeast India. Found near the site of Fustat, Egypt, this fragment highlights the maritime relationship of trade and a highly popularized market demand for cotton textiles produced in South Asia that spanned across areas linked by the Red Sea and larger Indian Ocean.","[[[216 218 218]

The textile’s ornamentation is associated to Gujarat as the fragment’s decorative program borrows heavily from Jain painted manuscript traditions and architecture commonly found and made in the province. The vibrancy of the red dye comes from the Indian mulberry plant, which was commonly used in dye practices also associated with Gujarat.Found near the site of Fustat, Egypt, these textiles have been preserved largely due to the arid and dry climate of the region.

The textile is decorated with a center piece of vegetal ogival motifs with emerging stylized tendrils and a series of borders with floriated medallions. The largest border of the textile, closest to the edge, is reminiscent of stylistic motifs which emulate Jain illustrated manuscript paintings and architecture surface ornamentation.This textile, which is one of a larger group of textile fragments found in Fustat, Egypt (known as old Cairo), but produced in Gujarat, India serves as evidence of the maritime trade relations between the two areas. This relationship can be traced as far back as the tenth century and extends into the nineteenth century. Fustat’s dry and arid climate allowed for the preservation of these textiles unlike the monsoon heavy climate in India which would have caused the deterioration of the design and fabric. Not only does this textile reveal the transregional connectivity of the Indian Ocean, but shows how the use of these brilliant and vibrant mordant dyes and block-printing techniques became hallmarks of Gujarati textile production and led to their demand and popularity across the globe.","[[[209 209 209]

Found in Fustat, Egypt (Old Cairo), this textile sheds light on the maritime trade of textiles between North Africa and Western India during this period.","[[[210 216 223]

Looking closely at Yuan period (ca. 1271–1368) silks, this textile emulates frontal facing lotus flowers seen in its center. The border of the textile fragment which include square-and-star patterning reflects Gujarati designs seen in tie-dye textiles (known as bandani.) The wavy lotus pattern was often used on Chinese storage jars found in Iran and therefore reflect the transregional dissemination of designs across geographies, especially during the fifteenth century.This textile fragment is one of a larger group of objects which were made in Gujarat, India, but found in Fustat, Egypt (known as Old Cairo.) It represents the intercontinental market and demand for vibrantly dyed and intricately block-printed Gujarati textiles that traveled across the Indian Ocean.","[[[183 183 183]

(31.1 cm)",near Fustat,Textiles-Painted and/or Printed,"This elaborately printed textile fragment is embellished with eight-pointed stars dotted with indigo interiors, diamond shapes, and curving tendrils which emerge from larger tear-drop motifs—some with pearled borders. The ornamentation of the textile fragment shares similar stylistic conventions to Jain manuscript paintings which were produced around the same time during the fourteenth century. This links the textile’s production site to the province of Gujarat, located in western India, which was an important textile production center as early as the tenth century.Retrieved from the burial grounds of Fustat, Egypt during the early twentieth century, this textile fragment would have once formed a larger burial shroud. Over the centuries, Gujarat became well-known for its vibrantly-colored printed textiles which were widely exported around the Indian Ocean. This textile fragment reflects the global interconnectivity of the Indian Ocean maritime trade network and serves as evidence for Fustat, Egypt as one of the major markets for these popular Gujarati textiles during the fourteenth century.","[[[234 246 250]

The red earing and iron bangles are customary accessories worn by dervishes of the Qalandar and Haydari orders. His forearms and chest are dotted with markings, caused by self-inflicted burns. These marks, known as dagh (hot) in Persian, demonstrate faithfulness and love for God.The scene suggests an allegory familiar to Sufis in which the higher self (here perhaps symbolized by the dervish) struggles to overcome his baser instincts (the bear). His burns, ragged garb, fasting, and wandering give him strength in this struggle.The Shah Jahan Album, also known as the Emperor's Album, features fifty illustrated and calligraphic folios, forty-one of which belong to the Metropolitan Museum, and nine of which reside in the collection of the Freer Gallery of Art.In lower part of second border around the portrait, Shah Jahan's handwriting identifies this as ""Work of Govardhan.""","[[[184 219 233]

Mir 'Ali, an artist of the Timurid court, was greatly admired, and avidly collected, by Jahangir and Shah Jahan.As seen here, works of calligraphy and painting from earlier eras were commonly included in Mughal-era albums and reset within contemporary Mughal margins. In this case, the margin, as well as the illumination surrounding the calligraphy, probably date from the seventeenth century, and the decoration of the delicately rendered flowering plants and grazing animals accords with such a dating.","[[[181 209 216]

Later emperors and other Muslim nobles followed his lead. This folio has come from a copy of the Mahabharata (known in Persian as the Razmnama) made for 'Abd al-Rahim ibn Muhammad Khan-i Khanan, army commander to Akbar and then Jahangir. Long in the service of the Mughals in a military capacity, 'Abd al-Rahim was also placed in charge of translating Babur's memoirs into Persian from Chaghatay Turkish, which reflects his literary interests. Though many others of his status had fine libraries, he was one of the few nobles who had books created for him, and six manuscripts are known to have come from his workshop of twenty artists. Like Akbar, he commissioned copies of the Ramayana and a Ragamala as well as the classic Khamsa of Dihlavi and the Panj Ganj of Jami.The Mahabharata is the story of the legendary war between the clans of the Kauravas and the Pandyas. The scene depicted here is the Battle of Arjuna and Raja Tamradhvaja. The painting cycle in 'Abd al-Rahim's book is the same as in Akbar's, and the large blocks of text that form part of the picture frame reflect the practice of the imperial atelier at that time.","[[[ 86  98  98]

In the story, Arjuna, a member of the Pandava clan and one of the protagonists of the work, travels with a white sacrificial horse. After being lost in the Vindhya mountains, the horse is rediscovered by Arjuna, his four brothers, and Krishna. The awkwardness of the composition, with the horse’s placement in space isolated in the midground, is unusual for works painted by the well-known artist Fazl, who may have been overwhelmed by the enormity of his role in the project.

W. 21 7/16 in. (54.5 cm)",,Textiles-Rugs,The theme of fantastic and grotesque animals was popular during the last quarter of sixteenth century in Mughal India. This carpet fragment of woolen pile on cotton warp and weft is one of the rarest types of Mughal carpets. A goat protrudes from the mouth of a lion while overlapping birds reciprocally face each other against a red colored background typical of Mughal carpets. The overall scheme is enigmatic with sparse foliage between the creatures. It seems to have been inspired by the Indian makara-torana an arch in which scrolls issue from the mouth of a hybrid elephant-headed crocodile.,"[[[ 12  12  12]

Here, seen through an arched opening, three sari-clad women meet in a flowering garden around a tree, with the raga identified as solanki, in both devanagari and Persian.","[[[219 224 223]

This shield, which belongs to the first quarter of eighteenth century, is ornately decorated with inlaid gold decoration on its rim and knob. The subject depicted on the border of the rim shows the ruler who is accompanied by his attendants’ aims with his rifle, gallops on a horse with a lance in his hand or attacks a furious lion. The hunting scene depicts dynamic movement with dogs and tiger jumping on their prey and an aggressive elephant trampling with a broken chain in its rear foot. The outer border contains stylized floral and leaf motifs characteristic of the period of Mughal Emperor Aurengzeb Alamgir. The central knob of the shield bears an intricately engraved landscape with architecture and rock formation. The profuse ornamentation of this shield suggests that it was likely a royal object.","[[[214 214 214]

Distant views of water hint at Bijapur’s former vastness, which, at its greatest extent, stretched to include Goa on the Arabian Sea. The key of legitimacy is being handed over by Isma’il, founder of the Safavid dynasty of Iran (here erroneously identified as Shah ‘Abbas in a later inscription), to Yusuf, founder of the Bijapur dynasty, symbolizing the unwavering allegiance of the ‘Adil Shahi family to the Shi’ite creed. During its golden period under the free-thinking Ibrahim II (1579–1626, shown third from right), however, Bijapur witnessed an open embrace of Hinduism and Sufism and the formalization in 1583 of Sunnism as the state religion, which lasted until the end of his tenure.","[[[178 206 217]

The spread was made through the laborious dyeing process known as kalamkari; remarkably, the usually fugitive green is very well preserved. In this process, green was achieved by painting a yellow dye over areas already tinted with indigo, but the yellow often faded, leaving only the undercoat of blue on historic kalamkaris.","[[[ 52  52  52]

This example has traditionally thought to have been from the period of Shah Jahan in India, when similar textiles are sometimes seen covering bolsters. Recent technical analysis however reveals that the manner of wrapping the metal around the thread, as well as character of the yarn and color of the dyes is characteristic of Persian production. This may indicate the presence of Persian craftsmen in Mughal India, or opens up the question of whether this textile was produced in Iran. The fragment is cut along the top and bottom yet preserves both right and left selvedges.","[[[153 153 153]

While he has captured the excitement of the fiercely partisan royal servants on the ground, they look unsubstantial compared to the thrusting power of the buffaloes' bodies.  The rounded haunch, the long straight line of the back, the bulging muscles of shoulder and neck of the animal on the left all point to inexorable victory, already sensed by the other, pushed off balance, with a foreleg curling under him.

The flowering plants are carefully painted, and eight different flower varieties can be identified.

Daggers such as this one were sometimes awarded to officers who had distinguished themselves in military victory and were worn at court as dress accessories indicating royal favor. Animal-headed hilts were especially favored, and the realism of their rendering conveys the keen appreciation for nature by Mughal artists.On this dagger, the hilt portrays a nilgai, or blue bull, one of the most beautiful animals found in India, and terminates at the base with a leafy scroll and lotus flower. Carved from a bluish-green nephrite that approximates the color of the animal, this hilt not only demonstrates the artist's thorough mastery of hard-stone carving, but also displays a level of accuracy and sensitivity that suggest close observation of a model, perhaps one of the captive animals kept in the imperial zoo.","[[[227 229 229]

For the Mughals, lions symbolized power and when accompanied by a lamb or calf signified the existence of peace and justice. This painting, one of the early works of Mansur, belongs to the period of Akbar and shows a resting lion reclining in the bulrushes besides the edge of a lake where birds perch and flit amidst the bamboo grove. The lion raises his hind legs while lightly crossing the fore paws in one of his natural poses. The sense of an idyllic landscape is enhanced by insects hovering in search of flowering plants. The three different size borders that frame the painting are embellished with ghubara (fine gold sprinkling) and shafaq (coarse gold application) technique, and the outer most with stylized floral and leaf motifs on a slender vine.","[[[177 206 215]

The overall pattern, created with outstanding technical skill, is engaging but not entirely succesful, since the thick frames of the elements that make up the first grid prevent an appropriate geometric and aesthetic reading of the second and more complex level of the composition.","[[[129 129 129]

Nasta'liq calligraphy, originally employed in Iran, had also been favored in India since the late sixteenth century. Here, the scribe was very conscious of the rhythms and balances of the horizontal and vertical letters, written diagonally. The strong black ink against the gentle swirls of the smoky blue and pale beige of the marbleized design gives the impression that the letters are floating, adding a mystical dimension to the page.The lines are from a Shi'ite prayer calling Imam 'Ali for help. The prayer is referred to as Nad-e 'Ali, and reads:Call 'Ali who manifests wonderful things,You will find him a help for you in difficulties.Every grief and sorrow will be cleared away by your sacred blessing,Oh 'Ali, Oh 'Ali, Oh 'AliWritten by the poor sinner Muhammad Salih, the scribe,may his sins be forgiven and his faults be covered.","[[[171 200 207]

Although the white and red walls of the fort are unmodulated planes, the placement of figures before them gives a sense of spatial recession. The dynamism of the elephant combat balances the impassive family portraits. While the courtiers in the upper tier turn their backs on the melee to face the royals, and the lower figures seem more concerned with the combat, curiously, none of them look directly at the object of their attention, somewhat diminishing the work's psychological intensity. Nevertheless, the artist subtly suggests that the emperor, under his gilded roof, is the lord of all beneath him.","[[[224 240 246]

(6.5 cm),,Stone,"In spite of its modest size, this flask in the shape of a mango, adorned with gold, gems, and enameling, eloquently demonstrates the artistic standards and tastes of seventeenth-century Mughal India. Likely to have been created during the reign of Shah Jahan, the emperor who built the famous Taj Mahal, the flask expresses the Mughal love of natural forms and precious materials. The finely balanced, elegantly drawn, and relatively spacious network of scrolling vines in gold, inset with gemstones, recalls the Mughal debt to Safavid Iran, where similar networks of scrolling vines with palmettes, blossoms, and leaves were in vogue in the sixteenth century.","[[[177 179 179]

Her image became a popular subject in Deccani painting, and she is frequently depicted hawking, as in this work. Here she rides a white horse, whose lower half has been colored red with henna to symbolize its wading through blood (or bravery in battle). Three female attendants accompany her on foot; one holds up a ceremonial sunshade behind the queen while another leads the way ahead of the horse. The figures are skillfully executed and the receding background is filled with charming details of animals, birds, hunters, and scenes of Indian village life.","[[[118 128 128]

The artist, working in the picturesque style, has chosen to depict the scene not by foregrounding the site’s majestic palace but rather by emphasizing a romanticized state of decay, with fallen debris from the nearby structures. In doing so, Sitaram creates a melancholic view suggesting a nostalgia for the Mughal Empire before the arrival of the British.","[[[198 213 222]

In his important position, Wellesley regularly received presents of rare flowers, birds, and animals from East India Company servants all over India and from travelers visiting from further east.

Surviving examples are recorded in European treasuries, including one made for the duke of Alba in the late sixteenth century (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). The stone was usually a compound of organic and inorganic materials, including bezoar, shell, amber, musk, resin, and crushed precious gems, which would be scraped and ingested with tea or water.The egg-shaped gold container enclosing this stone consists of hemispherical halves, each covered with a layer of pierced, chased, and chiseled gold foliate openwork. An arabesque surface pattern is overlaid with an ogival trellis containing a variety of beasts, some highly Europeanized, including unicorns and griffins. The source of these images is likely to have come to Goa through the Portuguese and may also reflect a particular European patron.

This technique ws associated with the city of Burhanpur, which became a center for the production of dyed textiles in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Burhanpur textiles show great influence from the nearby Mughal tradition, favoring floral motifs within the cusped arches and arabesque decoration. On the Coromandel Coast, different types of kalamkari textiles were produced, including palampores (bed covers) made for the European market, and sarongs and ceremonial hangings traded to Southeast Asia. This panel lined an eighteenth-century Ottoman tent in Bulgaria, and its medallion-based design was probably made to suit that market.","[[[0 0 0]

Often lavishly illustrated, it provides instructions on the hajj pilgrimage rituals and descriptions of important sites Muslim pilgrims can visit. The Futuh was popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when it was mainly copied in the Ottoman realm from Mecca to Istanbul, and also in Central Asia and India. Illustrations of sites and buildings are commonly shown from a bird’s-eye view. Symbols and other details enable the reader to identify sites where important miracles of the Prophet and other events took place. Differences in style and quality exist. This Deccani version presents considerable flourish through the curving orange lines of the trees, animated purple mountains concealing hidden grotesques at their rocky edges, and bright palette.","[[[ 86 113 139]

The Bara Imambara, whose name means “big shrine,” comprises the massive congregational mosque (seen at an angle at the upper right) and several interlocking forecourts. It is an important place of worship for Shia Muslims, who celebrate the religious festival of Muharram. This massive structure was commis-sioned by Nawab Asaf al-Daula of Lucknow as part of a famine-relief project.","[[[  9   2   0]

Wt. 63 lbs. (28.6 kg)",,Wood,"The flower style associated with the height of Mughal aesthetics and refinement finds expression in this pair of carved wood doors. The depiction of complete flowering plants, carved in low relief and placed in a symmetrical arrangement, is the hallmark of this style, which had its genesis in the reign of the Mughal emperor Jahangir (1605–27). In accordance with their patrons' interests, artists of this period studied European herbals, borrowing the techniques of combining front and side views and infusing the petals and leaves of the plants with a sense of movement. During the reign of Jahangir's son Shah Jahan (1627–58), and especially from the 1630s on, the plant studies were transformed into decorative motifs, arranged in rows to cover textiles, objects, and architectural spaces. As they were incorporated into stylized, symmetrically balanced compositions like those on the carved dadoes and inlaid panels at the Taj Mahal, the plants lost their botanical specificity.The use of wood was limited in Mughal architecture, and little of it remains. These doors are thus rare survivals of a tradition known through only a few other examples, including a pair of similar doors in the David Collection, Copenhagen.","[[[151 151 151]

The original album included 326 paintings, many of which, like the one here, were distinctively inscribed with the names of the artist and of Sir Elijah Impey's wife. This work has been signed in Persian by Shaikh Zain al-Din next to the inscription specifying ""in the Collection of Lady Impey in Calcutta"". Both inscriptions can be seen at the lower left. Zain al-Din, who is considered the foremost artist to have worked on Impey’s album, is believed to have painted from life, which accounts for the naturalism of his work. The bird in this picture appears to step up on the branch of the Bauhinia purpurea, while the moth rests lightly on the flower to drink its nectar. Although he was trained in Mughal techniques, the absence of landscape and even ground color derives from European natural history paintings, indicating that the artist was also familiar with European prints.","[[[200 229 250]

458378,Folio from an illustrated manuscript,"""Three Trees of India"", Folio from a Baburnama (Autobiography of Babur)",,late 16th century,"Ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on paper","H. 9 13/16 in.(25 cm)
W. 5 1/8 in. (13 cm)",,Codices,"The Baburnama, one of the most important texts of the Mughal period, provides insight into the literary, intellectual, and cultural world of Babur (1483–1530), founder of the Mughal empire.  The Baburnama is especially celebrated for its observations of India's natural world, an aspect of the text most pleasingly captured in the subject matter here.  The page depicts three trees: one on the recto (jackfruit) and two on the verso (monkey jack and lote).  Interspersed among the images are texts in nasta'liq Persian script describing the trees and their fruits.  During the reign of Babur's grandson Akbar (1556–1605), four imperial copies of the Baburnama were created, each illustrated by leading artists of the royal atelier.  This folio comes from the earliest of these copies, the 1589 manuscript, which was likely a model for the later versions.  It is thought originally to have contained 191 illustrations, many of which were dispersed in 1913, with a substantial portion remaining in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.  The collaboration between two or more artists, as seen here, was typical of early Mughal workshop practice.","[[[222 245 253]

Indian lutes figure prominently in ragamala paintings since they are commonly used to accompany singers and for melodic instrumental solos. The sursanga marks an important musical transition from the dhrupad vocal style to modern styles of khyal and thumri. The sursanga is thought to be a descendent of the Indian rabab and an ancestor of the sarod—the instrument made internationally renowned by Ali Akbar Khan. This elaborately decorated example, with gold on a green ground, is part of a suite of instruments donated to the Metropolitan Museum at the end of the nineteenth century by the renowned Indian musicologist Raja Sir Sourindro Mohun Tagore in an effort to promote the appreciation for Indian musical traditions worldwide.","[[[255 255 255]

As seen in the paintings in this exhibition, musicians hold a rudra vina at an angle with one of the stabilizing gourds positioned above the left shoulder. Rudra vinas are closely associated with the dhrupad genre of North Indian classical music popular from the sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth century. Tansen, the legendary sixteenth-century musician in the court of the Mughal emperor Akbar, was a widely revered vina player. His influence on North Indian classical music cannot be overstated, and countless musicians today trace their musical lineage to him.","[[[242 242 242]

500909,Sruti Upanga,Sruti Upanga,,,"Cane, goatskin, hemp, wax",Single cane chanter L. 22 cm,,Aerophone-Reed Vibrated-bagpipe,"The sruti upanga is a bagpipe that was historically played throughout Southern and Central India (Day 1891, Sonnerat 1782:102). In line with its name (‘sruti’ means ‘drone - not to be confused with the sruti, a type of double reed shawn also from India), it was used as a drone accompaniment. The holes on the drone would be partially or completely plugged with wax to obtain the desired tone (Day 1891:Plate XVI). This bagpipe – also called bhazana sruti (Day 1891:Plate XVI), tourti (Sonnerat 1782:102), or titti in Andhra Pradesh (Roghair 1982:33) – was played in a range of settings.In Tamil Nadu, the sruti upanga was used within an ensemble of musicians, who accompanied the devadasi. Devadasi, whose name means ‘servant of God’ were female dancers who were dedicated to a deity in a local temple. Devadasi practiced Indian classical dancing, both within the temple and in private celebrations. Their singing and dancing were accompanied by male musicians, who were from a different household to theirs, but were from the same community or hereditary lineage of temple musicians (Srinivasan 1985). A range of percussion, string, and wind instruments were used in these temple and community settings, with the bagpipe (sruti upanga) serving as the drone. Eighteenth century Company paintings from Madras (now known as Chennai), commissioned by the British to illustrate life in India, were painted by Indian artists and regularly included bagpipes in illustrations featuring the devadasi and their musicians. Many of these are labelled as Nautch dancers, an anglicized term derived from the Hindustani ‘nāch’ (dance). The simplification of the devadasi’s activity to ‘dance’ reduced their complex role in society, and contributed to an anti-nautch campaign that not only portrayed devadasi as temple prostitutes (Meduri 2018:303). This led to the ‘Madras Devadasis Prevention of Dedication Act’ 1947, effectively putting an end to the practice, as the women were disempowered and became unable to earn a living (Srinivasan 1985:1869). It also endangered Classical Indian dancing, which had been until then the hereditary knowledge of the devadasi. In order to counteract this, this practice was rebranded as ‘Bharatanatyam’ and was taken up by middle class women, thus placing it in a more acceptable social frame (ibid.)The drone bagpipe in Devadasi contexts was still in use at the turn of the 20th century, as evidenced by late 19th century photographs (cf. the reproduction in Hutchinson 1901). They were probably replaced by the sruti box in the early 20th century, as it became popularized throughout India.While the sruti upanga disappeared in Tamil Nadur in the early 20th century, in Andhra Pradesh (Central India), the sruti upanga (or titti) was still in use in the early 1980s, as evidenced by Roghair’s monograph published in 1982 (plates 2-3). Here, the bagpipe  was also used a drone instrument used to accompany Telugu epic singers (Roghair 1982:33). The drone pipes, made out of a goatskin and bamboo pipes, provided the background note for a regulated musical ensemble of drums (pamdajōḍu), finger cymbals (tāḷamu) accompanying the narrative singer, the Vῑra Vidyavantulu (ibid.). These epics could take up to thirty days to complete, with each story or section lasting about an hour, providing a rationale as to why a bag-based drone rather than one created through circular breathing, might have been a preferred option.(Cassandre Balosso-Bardin, 2023)Technical DescriptionSingle cane drone, 7/0 holes, cylindrical bore, 22 cm.

(17 × 12.2 cm),,Membranophone-double-headed / waisted drum,"Siva, Hindu Lord of destruction, regeneration and mythic inventor of drums, plays the damaru when he appears as Natesa, Lord of Dancers. He twists the hourglass-shaped drum causing pellets, attached by strings at its waist, to strike the skin heads which cover each end. Its rhythmic reverberations, a primal sound of creation, moves the cosmos in an ever changing, endless dance. The damaru's long association with Siva represents but one context in which this widely distributed instrument type is found. Known by diverse names throughout South Asia, the Himalayas, and Mongolia, the instrument's unrestricted use places it in the mortal hands of members of any social stratum, from priests to beggars. Drums like this one are usually made of plain or turned and painted wood although metal ones are not uncommon. This rare, 18th century, ivory damaru is encircled by incised and carved bands. Bands close to the open ends contain integral beading while ones nearer the waist reveal remnants of silver beads. Criss-cross and parabolic patterns resulting from the lathe's changing cutting angle appear beneath the reddish-brown patina. The drum's interior, usually blocked from view when covered by skin membranes, is concentrically grooved.","[[[251 251 251]

The use of tiger claws as symbols of power and protection is an ancient motif in India, seen also in gold pendants from ninth-century Java and other regions of Asia. Here, their talismanic properties of the necklace are enhanced by the navaratan gem setting (nine auspicious gems, although here, ten, since there are ten sets of claws).Mughal-style jewelry is replete with this arrangement of colored gems, each relating to a celestial body within traditional astronomical and astrological beliefs. The technique of this necklace is that of kundan, whereby stones are held in place by pure, pressed gold.","[[[238 238 238]

Thanks to their mercantile skills, Christian faith, and dispersed community, the Armenians had a successful network in Europe and Asia. Cloth that was sold in lengths in Europe was then fashioned into church vestments such as this one. The fact that the hood is sewn under the orphrey appears to indicate that the piece was assembled in Rome, where this practice is typical. The regular rows of blossoms on a precious metal ground recall Mughal Indian textiles of the second half of the 17th century, while certain technical details of the weaving and use of metal-wrapped threads is more typical of Iranian textiles. The stylistic closeness of the two point to the popularity of these silks in both Iran and India.","[[[223 214 204]

Portraits of Africans in the Deccan are illustrated in the same manner as other courtiers in this period, and these paintings reflect the unique form of social mobility sometimes afforded in Islamicate systems of slavery.

W. 53 1/2 in. (135.9 cm)",,Textiles,"Kashmir shawls are known for being part of the sophisticated male dress/garderobe at the court of the Mughal Emperor Akbar (r. 1555–1605). They became items of fashionable dress in Europe by the late 18th century and had reached the peak of their popularity there during the first half of the 19th century. Leaders of fashion such as the Empress Josephine in France and Emma Hamilton in Britain owned large collections of Kashmiri shawls, which elegantly complemented the loose-fitting ""Empire"" fashions of the time. By the mid-19th century, the designs became denser and more elaborate. The traditional pine-cone pattern became highly stylized to accommodate European tastes.The elaborate design of this shawl is typical of the kind woven in India for the British and European market in the 19th century. While the finest Kashmiri shawls are made of soft and expensive pashmina wool (the soft under-hair of the Himalayan goat) and have designs woven on the loom, many examples from the 1830s onwards, such as this one, favored embroidery to achieve similar decorative schemes. Such a technique was easier and quicker to manufacture and thus better positioned to respond to the growing demand and market in Europe in the second half of the 19th century.","[[[203 197 192]
