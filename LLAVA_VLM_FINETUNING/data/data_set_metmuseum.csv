During the reign of Jahangir's son Shah Jahan (1627–58), and especially from the 1630s on, the plant studies were transformed into decorative motifs, arranged in rows to cover textiles, objects, and architectural spaces. As they were incorporated into stylized, symmetrically balanced compositions like those on the carved dadoes and inlaid panels at the Taj Mahal, the plants lost their botanical specificity.The use of wood was limited in Mughal architecture, and little of it remains.

In line with its name (‘sruti’ means ‘drone - not to be confused with the sruti, a type of double reed shawn also from India), it was used as a drone accompaniment. The holes on the drone would be partially or completely plugged with wax to obtain the desired tone (Day 1891:Plate XVI). This bagpipe – also called bhazana sruti (Day 1891:Plate XVI), tourti (Sonnerat 1782:102), or titti in Andhra Pradesh (Roghair 1982:33) – was played in a range of settings.In Tamil Nadu, the sruti upanga was used within an ensemble of musicians, who accompanied the devadasi. Devadasi, whose name means ‘servant of God’ were female dancers who were dedicated to a deity in a local temple. Devadasi practiced Indian classical dancing, both within the temple and in private celebrations. Their singing and dancing were accompanied by male musicians, who were from a different household to theirs, but were from the same community or hereditary lineage of temple musicians (Srinivasan 1985). A range of percussion, string, and wind instruments were used in these temple and community settings, with the bagpipe (sruti upanga) serving as the drone. Eighteenth century Company paintings from Madras (now known as Chennai), commissioned by the British to illustrate life in India, were painted by Indian artists and regularly included bagpipes in illustrations featuring the devadasi and their musicians. Many of these are labelled as Nautch dancers, an anglicized term derived from the Hindustani ‘nāch’ (dance). The simplification of the devadasi’s activity to ‘dance’ reduced their complex role in society, and contributed to an anti-nautch campaign that not only portrayed devadasi as temple prostitutes (Meduri 2018:303). This led to the ‘Madras Devadasis Prevention of Dedication Act’ 1947, effectively putting an end to the practice, as the women were disempowered and became unable to earn a living (Srinivasan 1985:1869). It also endangered Classical Indian dancing, which had been until then the hereditary knowledge of the devadasi. In order to counteract this, this practice was rebranded as ‘Bharatanatyam’ and was taken up by middle class women, thus placing it in a more acceptable social frame (ibid.)The drone bagpipe in Devadasi contexts was still in use at the turn of the 20th century, as evidenced by late 19th century photographs (cf. the reproduction in Hutchinson 1901). They were probably replaced by the sruti box in the early 20th century, as it became popularized throughout India.While the sruti upanga disappeared in Tamil Nadur in the early 20th century, in Andhra Pradesh (Central India), the sruti upanga (or titti) was still in use in the early 1980s, as evidenced by Roghair’s monograph published in 1982 (plates 2-3). Here, the bagpipe  was also used a drone instrument used to accompany Telugu epic singers (Roghair 1982:33). The drone pipes, made out of a goatskin and bamboo pipes, provided the background note for a regulated musical ensemble of drums (pamdajōḍu), finger cymbals (tāḷamu) accompanying the narrative singer, the Vῑra Vidyavantulu (ibid.). These epics could take up to thirty days to complete, with each story or section lasting about an hour, providing a rationale as to why a bag-based drone rather than one created through circular breathing, might have been a preferred option.(Cassandre Balosso-Bardin, 2023)Technical DescriptionSingle cane drone, 7/0 holes, cylindrical bore, 22 cm.

W. 53 1/2 in. (135.9 cm)",,Textiles,"Kashmir shawls are known for being part of the sophisticated male dress/garderobe at the court of the Mughal Emperor Akbar (r. 1555–1605). They became items of fashionable dress in Europe by the late 18th century and had reached the peak of their popularity there during the first half of the 19th century. Leaders of fashion such as the Empress Josephine in France and Emma Hamilton in Britain owned large collections of Kashmiri shawls, which elegantly complemented the loose-fitting ""Empire"" fashions of the time. By the mid-19th century, the designs became denser and more elaborate. The traditional pine-cone pattern became highly stylized to accommodate European tastes.The elaborate design of this shawl is typical of the kind woven in India for the British and European market in the 19th century. While the finest Kashmiri shawls are made of soft and expensive pashmina wool (the soft under-hair of the Himalayan goat) and have designs woven on the loom, many examples from the 1830s onwards, such as this one, favored embroidery to achieve similar decorative schemes. Such a technique was easier and quicker to manufacture and thus better positioned to respond to the growing demand and market in Europe in the second half of the 19th century.", What is the name of the art piece?, Shawl, To what century does the Shawl belong?, 19th century, What material is used to make the Shawl?, Wool, What influenced the popularity of shawls in Europe?," The sophisticated male dress of the Mughal court and the fashion trends of the ""Empire"" era."
